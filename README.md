# Modular-Machine-Learning-Pipeline
This project demonstrates how to build a modular, reusable machine learning pipeline with separate modules for preprocessing, training, and evaluation.  The pipeline is designed to be dataset-agnostic (can work on multiple CSV datasets) and includes hyperparameter tuning, model saving, preprocessing pipeline saving, and evaluation visualization.
